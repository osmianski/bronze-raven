At the first sight, this website is just nothing fancy. But the first impression is misleading.

The thing is, you can edit the web pages right here in the browser. 

For example, to edit the title of a page, click on it - and it becomes editable, change the text to your liking,  press `Enter` - and voil√† - it's changed, forever!

Yes, it's that simple. In fact, it's even simpler - you even need the `Enter` - just click outside the title, and your changes are still applied. 

There is more. To cancel editing, press `Escape`. To confirm the changes and edit the page content, press `Tab`.

Content editing works just the same, just use `Ctrl + Enter` to confirm the changes.

There is even more. If someone else edits the same page, their changes are shown to you in an instant!
